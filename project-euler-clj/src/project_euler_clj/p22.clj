;; Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K
;; text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by
;; sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the
;; alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its
;; alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
;; For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order,
;; COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is
;; the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of
;; 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
;; What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
